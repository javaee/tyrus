<body>
<h1>Basic Authentication Sample</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates how to configure Tyrus client to connect on access protected server endpoint over HTTPS.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>
    The application utilizes access protected endpoint <code>org.glassfish.tyrus.sample.echo.auth.BasicAuthEchoEndpoint</code>
    to receive messages, add the text and send it back.
    Server endpoint is configured in web.xml to be under access protected resource and Authentication scheme is set to Basic.
    Transport guarantee is set to CONFIDENTIAL, which basically means over HTTPS.
</p>

<p>
    Configuration of client is quite simple, have a look at <code>org.glassfish.tyrus.sample.echo.auth.SampleBasicAuthTest</code>.
    If you use Basic or Digest Authentication scheme only <code>ClientProperties.CREDENTIALS</code> property must be set
    on client and that's it.
    Hint: It might be useful to deploy some static content into protected area with your server endpoint. If your
    client does not work at the first attempt you can simply test server configuration in web browser.
</p>

<h2>Running the Example with <a href="https://glassfish.java.net">Glassfish</a></h2>

<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Create war package</p>
        <blockquote><code>mvn clean package</code></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Setup GlassFish 4.0 (installed at <code>AS_HOME=&lt;install_dir&gt;/glassfish4</code>):
        <ul>
            <li>Add new security realm called "<code>ws-realm</code>"
                <ul>
                    <li>Start GlassFish using asadmin <code>$AS_HOME/bin/asadmin start-domain</code></li>
                    <li>Access Admin console, assuming the use of default admin port, at
                        <a href="http://localhost:4848">http://localhost:4848</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Navigate in Admin console to: <code>Configurations -&gt; server-config -&gt; Security -&gt;
                        Realms</code>,
                        click on "<code>New...</code>"
