    <h4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</h4>
    <p>This JSR will define a standard API for creating WebSocket
      applications.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of web applications that rely on timely
      updates from a central server like stock tickers, live maps, chat
      applications, collaborative online tools and multiplayer web-based
      games. WebSocket offers solution to the problems of latency,
      scalability and performance associated with HTTP based solutions
      like polling, long-polling and HTTP-streaming. There is a lot of
      interest in the Java developer community in creating web
      applications for the Java platform that utilize WebSocket. Given
      that the definition of WebSocket protocol is a proposed standard,
      and that the major web browsers either support, or plan to support
      it in their next major release, the time is right for a standard
      Java API for WebSocket.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This JSR will provide support in the Java EE platform for:-<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating WebSocket Java components to handle bi-directional
        WebSocket conversations</li>
      <li>Initiating and intercepting WebSocket events</li>
      <li>Creation and consumption of WebSocket text and binary messages</li>
      <li>The abililty to define WebSocket protocols and content models
        for an application<br>
      </li>
      <li>Configuration and management of WebSocket sessions, like
        timeouts, retries, cookies, connection pooling<br>
      </li>
      <li>Specification of how WebSocket application will work within
        the Java EE security model</li>
    </ul>
    This functionality will be a mix of APIs together with Java
    annotations to make for a flexible and easy to use programming
    model, as is found in other Java APIs in the Java EE platform.<br>
    <br>
    The primary scenario is for that applications created using this
    technology be server based. That is to say, this technology will be
    for Java EE developers creating WebSocket applications in
    bi-directional commutation with browser clients. This is exemplified
    by a chat application, consisting of a web page, executing a client
    script that connects to a server application. The server application
    accepts new chat participants using the web sockets handshake,
    accepts incoming chat messages, broadcasts updates of the currently
    participating users to all clients in session, mediates
    client-to-client chat sessions.<br>
    <br>
    A secondary scenario, is that this API will aid Java-clients of
    WebSocket applications residing on a server. This scenario is
    illustrated by a Java-based chat client participating in the chat
    example above. <br>
    <br>
    This JSR will explore a separable client-API for WebSocket that will
    run standalone on Java SE (specifically including API support for
    initiating WebSocket communication) as part of its first release, or
    may defer this to a later release.<br>
    <h4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server,
      personal, embedded, card, etc.)</h4>
    <p>This specification is targeted for Java EE. </p>
    <h4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters
      think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the
      Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which
      platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR
      has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</h4>
    <p>This specification targets the Java EE 7 Platform. It will be
      based on the corresponding release of the Java SE platform. </p>
    <h4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</h4>
    <p>No. Just the SE/EE Executive Committee. </p>
    <h4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the
      proposed specification?</h4>
    <p>The Java community has already seen the need to use WebSocket
      from Java applications, as can be seen from the list of projects
      that already provide a way to do so. The Java community is best
      served by one standard API for using WebSocket in an application.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</h4>
    <p>Though WebSocket applications could be created by low level I/O
      APIs in Java SE, this approach is cumbersome and difficult. There
      is no standard Java API that is high enough level to make the
      creation of WebSocket applications simple.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology
      or technologies:</h4>
    <p>Since WebSocket is TCP based, and uses an HTTP 'handshake' to
      initiate and terminate a WebSocket session, this project will
      likely build on existing networking and HTTP-based APIs where
      appropriate. This JSR will work closely with the Java Servlet 3.1
      expert group who are exploring the integration of the intial
      handshake into the Java Servlet model.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification?
      (i.e., <tt>javapi.something</tt>, <tt>org.something</tt>, etc.)</h4>
    <p>Possibly: javax.websocket.* or under java.net.websocket.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on
      specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</h4>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by
      the current security model?</h4>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</h4>
    <p>This JSR will use the I18N support in Java SE. </p>
    <h4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be
      rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result
      of this work?</h4>
    <p>No. </p>
    <h4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the
      development of this specification.</h4>
    <p>We hope to deliver the final specification, reference
      implementation, and TCK in the Q1 of 2013. A rough schedule would
      be: </p>
